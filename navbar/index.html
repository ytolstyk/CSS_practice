        <p>Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? They were just sucked into space. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data.

        <p>Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? They were just sucked into space. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Talk about going nowhere fast. Our neural pathways have become accustomed to your sensory input patterns. Well, that's certainly good to know. Ensign Babyface! and attack the Romulans. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'?</p>
